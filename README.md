Comp#110 Coding Task 2 
===================
By Emiljano Kurbiba

This is my Markdown documentation of what I will be doing for the Coding Task 2

----------

**Requirements**

You are required to have:

Doomed Patient Game
Keyboard
Mouse


Project Description
-------------

For this project I will be adding sprites that change depend on where you are in the games evironment and implementing them in the Group 150 Project game If possible we could find a simpler way to implement Player to environment interactivity, reason I chose to do this was because I felt the game wasn't enough visually and while the game was fun I would like to be able to interact with the environment more.

> **Plan:**

> - Design Alternate Sprite for approaching/changing door.
> - Implement Sprite into game.
> - Implement an approach function for the game where on approach of the door the sprite function will happen, this being that it will change sprite.


**Design**

When it came down to it I designed the alternate Doors so the user recieves visual feedback that the door is open.
![Something like this](https://i.imgsafe.org/d2bbd94919.jpg "This is the design")


**Environment Interactivity**
Instead the project took a whole different turn, trying to make the player interact with the door with (Harriet's help) we created a simpler way on player-to surroundings component/functionality. 

**Special Thanks**
Harriet Moore, She helped me increadibly through trial and error over and over for interactivity between player and surroundings.

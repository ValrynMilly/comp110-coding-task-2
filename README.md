Comp#110 Coding Task 2 
===================
By Emiljano Kurbiba

This is my Markdown documentation of what I will be doing for the Coding Task 2

----------


Project
-------------

For this project I will be creating Animated sprites and implementing them in the Group 150 Project game If possible we could find a simpler way to implement Player to environment interactivity, reason I chose to do this was because I felt the game wasn't enough visually and while the game was fun I would like to be able to interact with the environment more.

> **Plan:**

> - Design Animated Sprites for the Key/Exit
> - Design Animated Sprite for approaching door.
> - Implement Sprite into game.
> - Implement an approach function for the game where on approach of the door the sprite function will happen.


**Design**

When it came down to it I designed the Exit/Key as a gif format since it'll be constantly looped & Actions on collision wont affect the animation process of it.

**Made Designs**
I designed a key and a new door. instead the door would be see through when you walk up to it

**Environment Interactivity**
Instead the project took a whole different turn, trying to make the player interact with the door with (Harriet's help) we created a simpler way on player-to surroundings component/functionality. 

**Special Thanks**
Harriet Moore, She helped me increadibly through trial and error over and over for interactivity between player and surroundings.
